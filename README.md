# ChatPlatformProject

Have been working on this Chat platform project tring to familiarize myself more and more with C# and .NET 

This project is being developed using Blazor web assembly and SignalR in ASP.NET core.

Building a chat app following Patrick God's Tutorial : https://youtu.be/OBsPTuvW3ok      
His GitHub Repo : https://github.com/patrickgod/BlazorChatSignalR

My project is still incomplete have to implement autoscroll to the bottom but that requires JS. It has been implemented in Patricks work.
